# Study Tracker

Study Tracker is a Python CLI tool designed to help users track study habits and increase productivity.
## Installation

As of now, this project only uses the standard Python libraries, so no external dependencies are required. 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leif-hill/study-tracker.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd study-tracker
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python studytracker.py 

## Future Plans

Here are some features I plan to add to this project in the future:

- **Data Visualization**: Add graphical representations of study data, probably using Matplotlib
- **Predictive Analysis**: Implement a linear regression algorithm to project total expected hours studied within a month (or other timeframe - TBD)
- **Streak Tracker**: Recognize, track, and reward study streaks
